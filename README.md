In this submission, My analysis answered these questions:
- What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
- How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
- What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
- What's our average order value?
- How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)

My analysis shows that Weekends (Friday-Sunday) are the busiest days for Plato Pizza. On these weekends, the Pizza hut gets busy from around 4pm in the evening through 11pm in the night. 
Whereas, during the weekdays (Monday-Thursaday), Plato Pizza hut gets busy during Lunch hours (12pm-1pm).

Plato Pizza fulfilled more than 48k orders, with 21.4k Pizzas sold during the 12-months of 2015. For each order by its customers, the average order bought 2.3 pizzas at an average value of $37.6 USD. 

Although Plato Pizza's Pizza categorisation is in 4-different pizza varieties, there is no significant difference in the amount of revenue each pizza brings to the organisation. Whereas, in term of size, Plato Pizza sells 4-distinct sizes, Large, Medium, Small and Extra Large.

In terms of how it utilises its space, Plato Pizza has 60 chairs and 15 tables, implying 4 chairs per table. However, from the analysis, the current sitting arrangemne is not optimal, there are days when the number of customers in the hut are more than the seats available. As such, given that Plato Pizza has an average pizza value of 2.3 pizzas, it is better to have table of 2 for couples and table of 5 for families.

Overall, The Thai Chicken Pizza is Plato Pizza's best selling pizza, bringing in around 7.5% of all total sales, while the Baire Pizza is the worst selling pizza by Plato Pizza.
